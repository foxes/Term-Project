Changes - Gabe

UseCase.Java: I didn't really touch UseCase.java

Project.Java: Changed from arraylist to hashmap for better functionality

GUI.Java: Made alot of changes here, the code is pretty sloppy right now.
Basically made the save, create, adn edit functions work more or less. Load hasn't really been touched.
Also on start up will display Creat and load buttons center screen used a sloppy grid method to do it can 
improve upon later.

UseCaseEditor: Changed ok to Save and made it save the variables correctly by linking it with the gui class
so on click of save runs save method in gui, changed a few other things around

Note i really need to start commenting code...
Any issues with any of my code email me any time tommorow and should get back pretty quick

I am gonna work on the Project around 8ish pm tommorrow Ill start with trying to get the project jtree/layout up.
